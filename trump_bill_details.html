        <h1>Detailed Impacts of the Big Bill</h1>
        <p>This page reproduces the longer narrative explaining how the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" affects many areas: transportation, technology, energy, scientific research, immigration, and more. These paragraphs provide additional context beyond the quick bullet points.</p>
        <h2>Transportation and Transit</h2>
        <p>The bill steers new Highway Trust Fund revenue exclusively toward highways, leaving transit without its traditional share. Amtrak and bus services are largely ignored, and grants for neighborhood access and equity are rescinded. The result is far less federal help for subways, buses, and bike lanes.</p>
        <h2>Accessibility and Technology</h2>
        <p>Although programs like NLS BARD are not directly cut, broad domestic spending reductions could tighten future budgets. A controversial provision to bar local regulation of artificial intelligence was removed in the Senate, leaving state and city authority intact.</p>
        <h2>Clean Energy and Climate</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act are rolled back. Tax credits for solar, wind, and geothermal projects disappear after 2026, and electric vehicle incentives end even sooner. At the same time, the bill requires more oil and gas leasing on public land and postpones methane fees, signaling a pivot away from aggressive climate policy.</p>
        <h2>Space Exploration and Science</h2>
        <p>The legislation directs $10&nbsp;billion to Mars exploration and funds a future de-orbit of the International Space Station. However, it omits new money for the Artemis lunar program or for major space telescopes, leaving those projects to compete in regular appropriations.</p>
        <h2>Parks and Land Use</h2>
        <p>While a proposal to sell off federal land was dropped, the law mandates continued oil and gas lease sales. It also sets aside $40&nbsp;million for a National Garden of American Heroes. National parks themselves see no direct cuts, but environmental advocates worry about increased drilling activity near protected areas.</p>
        <h2>City and State Impacts</h2>
        <p>Municipal bonds remain tax exempt, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit expands, which helps cities finance projects. On the other hand, states must cover more Medicaid and SNAP costs, potentially squeezing budgets. The SALT deduction cap is temporarily lifted to $40,000, offering relief to residents in high-tax areas.</p>
        <h2>Immigration and Border Security</h2>
        <p>Fees for work visas rise and remittances leaving the country are taxed at 1%. The bill pours money into border enforcement—more wall construction, detention beds, and agents—while introducing new fees for asylum seekers and humanitarian applicants.</p>
        <h2>International Context</h2>
        <p>Defense spending increases may help sustain aid to Ukraine and bolster U.S. commitments in the Indo-Pacific. Yet rolling back clean-energy initiatives could undercut American climate leadership abroad, and new tariffs on low-value imports signal a more protectionist trade stance.</p>
        <h2>Fiscal Outlook</h2>
        <p>The extension of the 2017 tax cuts reduces federal revenue even as the bill's spending provisions add costs. Analysts project roughly $3&nbsp;trillion in additional debt over ten years, a concern underscored by Moody's credit downgrade.</p>
